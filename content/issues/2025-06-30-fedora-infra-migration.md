Fedora Infrastructure is currently ongoing migration to different datacenter,
during this migration majority of the contributor-facing services will be down.

Therefore it is expected that `sync-release` (i.e., `propose-downstream` and
`pull-from-upstream`), `koji_build`, and `bodhi_update` Packit workflows will be
affected.

Copr build jobs may be disrupted, full outage is not expected.

### Update - 4th July
Most services in Fedora Infrastructure should be up and running again.
Packit has resumed processing `copr_build` jobs, but there are still delays due to jobs being queued during the outage in previous days.
We are continuing to investigate issues related to pushing and pulling from dist-git, which are currently impacting downstream jobs. 
Weâ€™ll share further updates as soon as we have more information.
