Testing Farm had an outage caused by a recent change in Copr frontend, affecting most of Testing Farm runs in Packit. The Copr team has applied a fix to resolve the issue. More details: https://status.testing-farm.io/issues/2025-12-10-public-ranch-requests-testing-against-copr-builds-are-broken/.

If the jobs ended on error they can be [retriggered](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/upstream/tests#restart-testing) by commenting `/packit test` in the corresponding pull requests.
